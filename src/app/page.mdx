  UI Component Ten Commandments
</h1>

<span className="text-justify">
  Behold! The etchings on this tablet
  contain essential wisdom for building
  excellent components. No singular
  commandment is greater than his
  brother, and no singular commandment
  is lesser than his sister. The
  following commandments do not always
  implement one another for brevity
  sake. Do not foresake them! Each
  commandment is authored to be overly
  concise, so as to focus on the
  principle at hand!

<span className="text-sm">
  The following commandments are not
  specifically tailored for [web
  components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).
  These commandments are for UI
  component technologies en masse.
