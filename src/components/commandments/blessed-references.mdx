**Principle**: Predictability, Stability

Module state, global, and contextual references should
all be avoided.

<Wisdom>
  In software design generally, it is
  crucial to avoid relying on module
  state, global state, and contextual
  references. This practice enhances
  predictability and stability within
  your application. By minimizing
  dependencies on external states, you
  can create components that are more
  self-contained and easier to test.
  This approach also reduces the risk of
  unintended side effects, making your
  codebase more maintainable and robust.
