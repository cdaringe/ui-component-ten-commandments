**Principle**: Principle of least astonishment, Declarative UI

```tsx
type Props = {
  // `isOpen` declares the modal to be open or closed.
  // clear semantics make the component intuitive and
  // predictable.
  isOpen: boolean;
};
const Modal: FC<Props> = ({
  isOpen,
  ...unhandled
}) =>
  isOpen ? (
    <Overlay {...unhandled} />
  ) : null;
```

<CounterExample>
Examples of non-declarative interfaces are abundant. They could use non-descriptive names and be missing documentation, like the following,
```tsx
const Widget = ({
  item,
  data,
}: {
  item: string;
  data: any;
}) => (
  <>
    <span>{item}</span>
    <span>{data}</span>
  </>
);
```

but more often, bad interfaces come about by quickly building on the fly
with shallow consideration for the UI itself, and letting the present data
define the interface. It can be tempting to accept data in whatever shape you currently have it,
and design a component interface around that rather than design an interface
that is tailored to the component's intrinsics. Learn to identify these scenarios
and avoid hastily accepting data structures that do not align with the component's
purpose.
"Declarative interfaces" is analogous to data modeling, but with focus at the
component boundary.

```tsx
// ‚ùå Bad example. Using foreign data model, vs component local data model.
// Let's build a component that shows a product's prices, with a discount!
type DiscountPriceProps = {
  items: Item[]; // we accept all of the products,
  index: number; // and which product index it is
  // ü§î. Does a price viewer need knowledge of all of the items? Does it need
  // to know about the index? Certainly not!
};
const DiscountPrice: FC<
  DiscountPriceProps
> = ({
  items,
  index,
  className,
  ...unhandled
}) => {
  // The below logic handles cases that are not pertinent to drawing discounted
  // prices--it is only relevant to handling one callsite's obscure data model.
  // Data transformations should almost always be handled earlier in the call stack.
  if (
    !items ||
    index < 0 ||
    index >= items.length
  ) {
    return null;
  }
  const item = items[index];
  return (
    <div
      className={clsx(
        "price",
        className,
      )}
      {...unhandled}
    >
      {item.discountedPrice
        ? item.discountedPrice
        : item.price}
    </div>
  );
};
```

A better design, relative to the prior, would be akin to the following:

```tsx
type DiscountPriceProps = Pick<
  currentPrice: { scalar: number; uom: CurrencyCode },
  previousPrice: { scalar: number; uom: CurrencyCode },
>;
const DiscountPrice: FC<
  DiscountPriceProps
> = (props) => <snip-snip-snip />;
```

The declarative interface is clear and concise, focusing on the component's
intrinsic data model rather than the external data model. This makes it easier
to understand the component's purpose and how it should be used.

<Wisdom>
Writing declarative interfaces takes careful intention
by the developer. Field names should represent clear descriptors of the data,
or signal clear behavioral intent. This makes it easy for other developers to
understand the purpose of each field and how it affects the component's behavior.
