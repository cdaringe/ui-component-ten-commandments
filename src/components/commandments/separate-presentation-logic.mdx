> **Summary**: Separate presentational and logic dense concerns in components.

> **Principles**: Separation of concerns.

```tsx
// Presentational concerns
const UserCard = ({
  name,
  bio,
  ...rest
}: User & DivAttrs) => (
  <div {...rest}>
    <h1>{name}</h1>
    <p>{bio}</p>
  </div>
);

// Logic concerns
const UserCardContainer = ({
  userId,
  ...rest
}) => {
  const [userData, setUserData] =
    React.useState<User | null>(null);
  const { data, loading, error } =
    useQuery(getUser);
  if (loading)
    return (
      <div {...rest}>Loading...</div>
    );
  if (error)
    return (
      <ErrorCard
        {...rest}
        error={error}
      />
    );
  return (
    <UserCard {...data} {...rest} />
  );
};
```

<CounterExample>
```tsx
// ❌ Avoid: monolithic components handling both logic dense
// operations, like API client fetching and rendering.
const UserDashboard = () => {
  const [userData, setUserData] =
    React.useState(null);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/user")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) =>
        setUserData(data),
      );
  }, []);
  if (!userData)
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userData.name}</h1>
      <p>{userData.bio}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In our UserCardContainer, the bulk of the code is focused on
getting data and handling interstitial states. Once a state is
known, we pass the state into a presentational layer to take over
the rest.

The benefits of this are numerous:

1. **Maintainability**: Logic and presentation can be maintained separately. If you need to change the logic for fetching user data, you can do so without affecting the presentation layer.
2. **Reusability**: The presentational component can be reused in other parts of the application without the logic layer, allowing for greater flexibility in how the component is used.
3. **Testability**: By separating concerns, you can write unit tests for both the logic and presentation layers independently. This makes it easier to ensure that each part of the component is working correctly.
4. **Comprehension**: Separating concerns makes it easier for developers to understand the purpose of each part of the component. The logic layer handles data fetching and state management, while the presentation layer focuses on rendering the UI.
5. **Collaboration**: In a team environment, different developers can work on the logic and presentation layers simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes. This can lead to faster development cycles and more efficient teamwork.

[Dan wrote about this over a decade ago](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0),
and even states that it can be harmful. For very basic state handling, co-locating is ok.
However, we generally advice that separation be the rule, versus the exception,
if the developer knows there will be non-trivial state and logic. In the above
example, a `UserCard` could certainly be present on various pages, and it may
not always have the same data-source. Further, to support testing and visual tools
like Storybook, the separation of concerns is crucial, otherwise developer tools
must onboard the complexity of supporting the logic layer, even if it is not needed
in these contexts.
