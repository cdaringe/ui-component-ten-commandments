**Principle**: Extensibility by default

```tsx
type Props = {
  foo: string;
} & HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>;

const Widget: FC<Props> = ({
  foo,
  ...unhandled
}) => <div {...unhandled}>{foo}</div>;
```

<Wisdom>
Components shall by default extend their root child component. Any
unhandled input (props, attributes, etc.) should be passed down to the
underlying component or DOM element. This permits great extensibility and
ensures that the component can be extended by the consumer
without needing to modify the component itself.

Does the caller need to pass an `id`? How about a click handler?
Following this commandment, your component already supports your
caller's needs.
