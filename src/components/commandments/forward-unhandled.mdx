> **Summary**: Components shall extend their root child component and pass unhandled props. This makes components feel like a natural extension of the target UI runtime.

> **Principles**: Extensibility by default.

```tsx
type Props = {
  foo: string;
} & HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>;

const Widget: FC<Props> = ({
  foo,
  ...unhandled
}) => <div {...unhandled}>{foo}</div>;
```

<CounterExample>
```tsx
const Form: FC<{ fields: FormField[] }> = () => (
  <form>
    {fields.map((field) => <FormField key={field.id} {...field} />)}
  </form>
);
```

What would a consumer possibly want to do with a form control? Perhaps:

1. Add an `onSubmit` handler?
2. Add an `id` or `className`?
3. Add a `data-*` attribute?
4. Add more children?

The takeaway is that there are _many_ reasons to want to extend the `form`, even
if the component needs only light extension. Testing alone often warrants this
addition to components.

Sadly, this commandment is challenging
to achieve in some of the interesting,
nominally typed UI languages out
theres, such as `Elm` or `ReScript`,
at least without using a preprocessor.

<Wisdom>
Components shall by default extend their root child component. Any
unhandled input (props, attributes, etc.) should be passed down to the
underlying component or DOM element. This permits great extensibility and
ensures that the component can be extended by the consumer
without needing to modify the component itself.

Does the caller need to pass an `id`? How about a click handler?
Following this commandment, your component already supports your
caller's needs.
