**Principle**: Encapsulation, Cohesion

```tsx
import preprocessClick from "./preprocessors/onclick";
const Widget = ({
  className,
  criticalResource,
  onClick: userOnClick,
  ...unhandled
}: {
  criticalResource: Resource;
  // ✂️ snip
}) => (
  <div
    // scoped/local styles, or utility styles minimize conflicts.
    className={clsx(
      className,
      "widget-container b-none w-full",
    )}
    // behaviors rely on local &/or passed resources. minimized coupling
    // to global or context-like implicit state.
    onClick={preprocessClick(
      userOnClick,
      criticalResource,
    )}
    {...unhandled}
  />
);
```

<Wisdom>
In UI programming, encapsulation is key to building robust components. This
means that a component should manage its own behavior and styles, rather than relying on external factors or global state. By encapsulating behavior and styles, you can ensure that your component is self-contained and can be reused in different contexts without unexpected side effects.
Building strictly with this principle commonly ends up producing components
that are functional (as in functional programming) in nature. Some developers
observe that such components, in an application context, often fall victim
to "prop drilling". There are a few strategies to mitigate this, including,
but not limited to, using intra-app messaging, consolidating cross-cutting resources
into a singular reference passed down, IoC for binding contextual behavior higher
up in the tree, and more.

This commandment reduces local complexity, while often incurring a minor addition
of complexity up your component tree, so as to support transporting input/props
down to your component. Leveraging other commandments help to minimize this
cost.

```tsx
// ❌ Bad
const Widget = ({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  // implicit coupling to non-guaranteed resource
  const criticalResource = useContext(
    CriticalResourceContext,
  );
  return (
    <div
      className="global-container"
      onClick={() =>
        userOnClick(criticalResource)
      }
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```
