**Principle**: Composable design

```tsx
const Card: FC<Props> = ({
  content,
  title,
  ...unhandled
}) => (
  /**
   * Our card has three primary sections: a heading, body content, and footer
   * We can see semantic component names corresponding to the anatomical structure
   */
  <div {...unhandled}>
    <Heading>{title}</Heading>
    {content}
    <Footer />
  </div>
);
```

<Wisdom>
Assembling smaller components into larger components is a well
established strategy to build robust and malleable components. The above example
demonstrates the principle by isolating `Heading` and `Footer` from
`Card` component. Building small components supports...

1. reusability (`Heading` can be freely used elsewhere),
2. maintainability (`Heading` & `Footer` can be developed in isolation),
3. comprehension (`Heading` & `Footer` can be studied in isolation),
4. testability (`Heading` & `Footer` can be tested in isolation, or swapped in `Card` during test if needed),
5. and separation of concerns.
