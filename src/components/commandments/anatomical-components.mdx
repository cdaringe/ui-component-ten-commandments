> **Summary**: Components should be built from parts that semantically represent their
> anatomical structure, and should also minimize inlining of markup which could
> otherwise be represented by a logical boundary.

> **Principles**: Composable design.

```tsx
const Card: FC<Props> = ({
  content,
  title,
  ...unhandled
}) => (
  /**
   * Our card has three primary sections: a heading, body content, and footer.
   * We can see semantic component names corresponding to the anatomical structure
   */
  <div {...unhandled}>
    <Heading>{title}</Heading>
    {content}
    <Footer />
  </div>
);
```

<CounterExample>
There is nothing technically wrong with the following code, yet it violates our
commandment. Specifically, we see the anatomy of our Card
smashed together. Something like an item `Card` or contact `Card` is a bit of a
mundane example, but something most web developers are familiar with.

```tsx
const Card: FC<Props> = ({
  content,
  title,
  ...unhandled
}) => (
  <div {...unhandled}>
    <h1 className="my-header p-2 font-bold uppercase">
      {formatHeader(title)}
    </h1>
    <footer className="my-footer flex bottom-0 p-2 justify-between">
      <div className="my-footer-links">
        {footerLinks.map((link) => {
          return (
            <a
              key={link.url}
              href={link.url}
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              {link.text}
            </a>
          );
        })}
      </div>
      <img src={logo} alt="logo" />
      <a
        className="hover:cursor-pointer"
        href="https://my.site.com/edit"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >
        <img
          src={editIcon}
          alt="edit"
        />
      </a>
    </footer>
  </div>
);
```

<Wisdom>
Assembling smaller components into larger components is a well
established strategy to build robust and malleable components. The above example
demonstrates the principle by isolating `Heading` and `Footer` from
`Card` component. Building small components supports...

1. reusability (`Heading` can be freely used elsewhere),
2. maintainability (`Heading` & `Footer` can be developed in isolation),
3. comprehension (`Heading` & `Footer` can be studied in isolation),
4. testability (`Heading` & `Footer` can be tested in isolation, or swapped in `Card` during test if needed),
5. and separation of concerns.
