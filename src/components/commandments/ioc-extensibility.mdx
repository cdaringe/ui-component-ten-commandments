**Principle**: Portability

```tsx
/// Setup - Consider component `Bar` which renders a `Foo`. The user may want
// to modify or change how `Foo` is rendered, including updating or overriding
// default props.

// foo.tsx
export const Foo = ({
  foo,
  ...rest
}) => <div {...rest}>{foo}</div>;

// bar.tsx
type Props = {
  /**
   * Inversion of Control (IoC) utilizes callbacks to render the
   * Foo component. This is known as the render-props pattern in React.
   */
  foo?: ({
    Component: Foo,
    props: FooProps,
  }) => JSX.Element;
};
const Bar: FC<Props> = ({
  foo,
  ...unhandled
}) => {
  const fooProps: FooProps = {
    className: "bg-blue flex",
    foo,
  };
  return (
    <div {...unhandled}>
      {foo({
        Component: Foo,
        props: fooProps,
      }) ?? <Foo {...fooProps} />}
    </div>
  );
};

// Usage. Observe using
// your-app.tsx
<Bar
  foo={({
    Component,
    props: { className, ...unhandled },
  }) => (
    <Component
      id="my-foo"
      className={`${className} my-classname`}
      {...unhandled}
      foo="Squashed foo!"
    />
  )}
/>;
```

<Wisdom>

Inversion of control (IoC), as administered via render props, is a powerful technique that allows a
component to delegate the responsibility of rendering a part of its
interface to its caller. This is particularly useful when you want to
provide a high degree of flexibility and extensibility in your
component's design. By allowing the caller to specify how a part of
the component should be rendered, you enable them to customize the
component's behavior and appearance without needing to modify the
component itself.
